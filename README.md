An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate
of R10.95 for the first item, and R2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a
function that takes the number of items in the customer’s order as its only
parameter. Return the shipping charge for the order as the function’s
result. Your program must read the number of items purchased from the
user and display the shipping charge.

Devise multiple test cases for your program, and carry out testing to
ensure that your program delivers the expected results.
